 this will be my hungry file

now one more time pull and push one more change to make sure I understand how to do the basics


Ackerman test //not sure if this will work in c b/c bool is not a type in gcc I believe
#include<math.h>

bool CheckValue(int n, int m, int c){
   int answer=0;
   switch (m){//switch finds row and answer is the intersection with appropriate column
      case 0: answer = n+1;
         break;
      case 1: answer = n+2;
         break;
      case 2: answer = 2n+3;
         break;
      case 3: answer = pow(2,(n+3))-3;
         break;
   }
   if(c != 0){//sanity check
      if(c==answer)return true;
         else return false;
   }
   else 
}
